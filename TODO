HTTP features:
Cache-Control response headers as origin server:
  public - may be cached in a shared cache
  private - may be cached in a private, but not a shared, cache
  no-cache - may not be cached
  no-store - may not even be written to disk (but who's gonna check/enforce this - bit pointless)
  no-transform - don't transform the result
  must-revalidate - cache must always revalidate once stale
  proxy-revalidate - as above but only applies to public cache not private cache. useful if eg you want stuff pulled from public caches after stale but not private
  max-age=123 - maximum age at which it may be stored in any cache, secs. implies public if nothing more restrictive specified.
  s-maxage=456 - maximum age at which it may be stored in a shared cache
